This is the webpage for the Honours/MSc course Online Experiments for Language Scientists, running in academic year 2024/2025. I will add links to materials (readings, code) to this page; you will need to use Learn for electronic submission of your assessed work, and to keep an eye on announcements.

**For non-Edinburgh people**: all the course materials are here and you are welcome to use them with attribution. If you would like us to run something like this for your students or research group, [contact Kenny](mailto:kenny.smith@ed.ac.uk).

## Course summary

Many areas in the language sciences rely on collecting data from human participants, from grammaticality judgments to behavioural responses (key presses, mouse clicks, spoken responses). While data collection traditionally takes place face-to-face, recent years have seen an explosion in the use of online data collection: participants take part remotely, providing responses through a survey tool or custom experimental software running in their web browser, with surveys or experiments often being advertised on crowdsourcing websites like Prolific and Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Online methods potentially allow rapid and low-effort collection of large samples; however, building and running these experiments poses challenges that differ from lab-based methods.

This course will provide a rapid tour of online experimental methods in the language sciences, covering a range of paradigms, from survey-like responses (e.g. as required for grammaticality judgments) through more standard psycholinguistic methods (button presses, mouse clicks) up to more ambitious and challenging techniques (e.g. voice recording, iterated learning, real-time interaction through text and/or streaming audio). Each week we will read a paper detailing a study using online methods, and look at code (written in javascript using jsPsych) to implement a similar experiment - the examples will skew towards the topics I am interested in (artificial language learning, communication, language evolution), but we'll cover more standard paradigms too (grammaticality judgments, self-paced reading) and the techniques are fairly general anyway. We'll also look at the main platforms for reaching paid participants, Prolific and MTurk, and discuss some of the challenges around data quality and the ethics of running on those platforms.

No prior experience in coding is assumed, but you have to be prepared to dive in and try things out; the assessment will involve elements of both literature review and coding.

## The teaching team

The course is co-taught by [Kenny Smith](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~kenny/) and [Alisdair Tullo](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/alisdair-tullo/). Kenny (that's me) is the main lecturer and the course organiser; Alisdair is the PPLS javascript/jsPsych guru and delivers the lab sessions with Kenny. Best way to get in touch with us is in one of the live sessions, see below, or by email to [kenny.smith@ed.ac.uk](mailto:kenny.smith@ed.ac.uk) or [alisdair.tullo@ed.ac.uk](mailto:alisdair.tullo@ed.ac.uk).

We'll also be supported in lab classes by [Maisy Hallam](https://maisyhallam.github.io) and [Yajun Liu](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/yajun-liu), who are doing their PhDs with me and use jsPsych to build online experiments for their own research.  

## Class times

Lectures take place on Monday mornings, 9am-9.50am, in room S1, on the second floor of [7 George Square](https://www.ed.ac.uk/maps/maps?building=0209). Labs are on Wednesday mornings, 9am-10.50am, in room M2 [Appleton Tower](https://www.ed.ac.uk/maps/maps?building=0201); this is an open-plan Teaching Studio on the mezzanine level. 

There will also be extra drop-in labs available in the run-up to the final assignment, see below.

Lectures and labs are both essential to doing well on the course - the assessment involves an understanding both of the literature on online experiments (covered in the readings and lectures) and the practicalities of how to build them (covered in your own work on the practicals, with support available in the labs). **Attendance will be taken in labs.**


## Assessment

There are different assessments for undergraduates and postgraduates.

### Undergraduate assessment 

The undergraduate version of the course is worth 20 credits and there are two pieces of assessment, due on 7th November and 5th December. Assessment 1 is an annotated bibliography reviewing and evaluating 4 articles typically drawn from the course set readings. Assessment 2 is a project where you produce a working experiment implemented in jsPsych and an accompanying report explaining the motivation behind that experiment, justifying important design decisions you took in building the experiment, and appraising the experiment and ways it could be improved/extended. Full details are provided in the [undergraduate assignment brief](assessment/UGAssignmentBrief2024.pdf) and [the FAQ](assessment/oels_assignment_faq.md) (which also features examples of good assignments). 

### Postgraduate assessment

The postgraduate version of the course is worth 10 credits and there is a single piece of assessment, due on 5th December. This assessment is a project where you produce a working experiment implemented in jsPsych and an accompanying report explaining the motivation behind that experiment, justifying important design decisions you took in building the experiment, and appraising the experiment and ways it could be improved/extended. Full details are provided in the [postgraduate assignment brief](assessment/PGAssignmentBrief2024.pdf) and [the FAQ](assessment/oels_assignment_faq.md) (which also features examples of good assignments). 

## Course Materials

Course content will appear here as we work through the course.

Each week there will be a set reading and a programming assignment. The reading involves a blog post introducing a published paper, you read both the blog and the paper, the lecture then provides an additional brief overview and an opportunity to ask questions/discuss the reading. The programming assignment involves working through a section of the [Online Experiments with jsPsych](https://softdev.ppls.ed.ac.uk/online_experiments/index.html) tutorial and/or looking at (and editing) some code which implements a language-related experiment; you can use the lab classes as dedicated time to work on the programming task and get help with programming difficulties or questions you have.

### Bonus content

I am sticking some extra documented experiments I have created here, in case they are useful for someone or provide inspiration.

- [Co-speech gesture experiment](bonus/cospeech_gesture.md), presenting a video and getting button/text responses.
- [Semantic extension experiment](https://github.com/kennysmithed/SemanticExtension). This is a more complex experiment looking at how participants extend the meaning of novel signals in a communication game. It is based on the dyadic interaction code from this course, but includes additional machinery to deal with a wider range of participant drop-outs, has on-screen trial counters, a warm-up with catch trials.
- [Custom html-button-response plugin with buttons laid out in a grid](https://github.com/aislinnkeogh/custom-jspysch-plugins/blob/main/plugin-html-button-response-grid.js), written by Aislinn Keogh - uses an html table to do that, the plugin provides 2 additional parameters, `rows` and `columns`, e.g. for a 3 row, 2 column grid you'd do ```{type: jsPsychHtmlButtonResponseGrid, rows: 3, columns: 2, choices: [6 choices here]}```

### Additional drop-in labs for coding help with the final assignment

We will provide some extra drop-in labs after the conclusion of the regular lectures and labs to give you an opportunity to get some help with your final assignment code. Obviously we won't write your code for you, but if you are having trouble interpreting an error message or finding a bug or want some tips on how to achieve a particular effect we can help you figure it out. Note that these are not compulsory, and they are drop-ins not extra labs - the idea is that you come along, ask a couple of questions, then go away. Times and locations **to be added**.
