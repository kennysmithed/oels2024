# Online Experiments for Language Scientists, semester 1 of the 2024-2025 academic year.

Full content for the course (code walkthroughs etc) in a readable format is at https://kennysmithed.github.io/oels2024/. You can find the markdown source and zipped code on the gh-pages branch. When the course is complete I will upload individual pieces of code here, some of which I had to zip up in the webpage version for convenience of the people downloading them.
